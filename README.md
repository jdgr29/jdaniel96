# 👋 Hi, I’m Daniel!

I'm a passionate full-stack developer specializing in JavaScript/TypeScript, React Native, and backend development with Node.js and Express. I love building innovative solutions, especially around blockchain and realestate tech.

## 🛠️ Technologies I work with:

- **Frontend:** JavaScript/TypeScript, React, React Native, Astro, Next.js, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js, Supabase, Solana blockchain
- **Other:** Git, Supabase, Sanity.io, Mapbox, Cloudinary

## 🚀 Current Projects:

- **HH**: A platform where users can post business ideas and startups, by creating and trading tokens on the Solana blockchain.
- **Meta Punta Cana**: A real estate web application where users can explore properties for sale and rent, with a client management dashboard.

## 🏆 Achievements:

- Built a custom backend solution integrating Solana blockchain for token management.
- Built a transaction abstraction in solana where users can send/receive token without owning SOL themselves
- Shipped successfully from start to finish an application to both Apple Store and Google Play Store

## 🤌🏽 I am learning:

- Python/Django
- Rust
- AWS

## ⚡ Fun fact:

I love binge-watching sci-fi shows like 'The Expanse', Horror themed shows and exploring the possibilities of AI-driven apps.
